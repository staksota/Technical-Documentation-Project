        <p>First Four-Cylinder in the HP Family is Lightest 1000cc Supersports Bike<br><br>

With the 2013 BMW HP4, BMW Motorrad presents the lightest 4-cylinder supersports bike in the 1000cc class to date. Based on the BMW S 1000 RR, the new HP4 has an output of 193 hp (142kW) and has a dry weight of 373 lbs (169 kg) including Race ABS . Race ready with a 90% full fuel tank just 439 lbs (199 kg).</p>
        <p>The new BMW HP4 sees its world premiere in 2012 and is a continuation of BMW Motorrad’s HP model series founded in 2005.  class="main-section" id=After the boxer models HP2 Enduro, HP2 Megamoto and HP2 Sport, the BMW HP4 is the first 4-cylinder motorcycle in the HP family.</p>
        <p>The HP label stands for high performance, and the HP4 once again embodies outstanding handling, power and riding dynamics. But it also reflects the use of extremely high-quality materials and intelligent technology, carefully conceived down to the last detail.</p>
        <p>BMW High Performance motorcycles are truly outstanding: exclusive and authentic, they will always remain relatively rare. This applies equally to the new BMW HP4. Each motorcycle is issued with its own HP4 serial number which is engraved indelibly in the upper fork bridge.</p>

      <header>Performance based on the S 1000 RR</header>
      <p>Since its international press presentation in autumn 2009, the S 1000 RR has attained many successes – and not just in motorcycle magazine comparative tests. This is clear evidence of the qualities and the consistency of the supersports concept. Equipped with Race ABS and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), the S 1000 RR set a new benchmark in this hotly contested and technologically sophisticated segment. But even the S 1000 RR left some room for improvement.</p>
      <p>The HP4 provides the homologation basis for the use of BMW motorcycles in motorcycle racing, especially in the superbike and superstock category. The new model features numerous technological innovations which highlight its orientation towards racing and the race track. The standard passenger seat cover ensures the monoposto (solo rider) look so characteristic of the race track. But for riders who would like to travel with a passenger, BMW Motorrad also offers a passenger package as a factory production option. In addition to the passenger seat, this includes the passenger footrest system.</p>

      <header>Dynamic Damping Control DDC</header>
      <p>With the introduction of Race ABS in the S 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad underscored its pioneering role in the area of ABS. For the first time ever, an antilock brake system was consistently tailored to sport riding.</p>
      <p>With the new race-oriented HP4, BMW Motorrad now takes the next step. Designed specifically for race track and dynamic road riding, the new bike not only has Brembo monoblock brake calipers and 9x floating brake discs at the front but also a further developed and refined Race ABS.</p>
      <p>As before, this ABS has four different modes for wet surfaces (“Rain”), roads (“Sport”), race track with supersports tires (“Race”) and race track with slicks (“Slick”). Racing experience gained from the IDM (International German Motorcycle Championship) has been fed directly into the Race ABS equipped HP4. In “Slick” mode, the so-called IDM setting with refined regulation impulses now gives the skilled rider the option of maximum possible deceleration.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Launch_Control">
      <header>Launch Control</header>
      <p>The HP4 is the first BMW motorcycle to have a Launch Control function which provides active support for the rider in “Slick” mode to achieve maximum acceleration from standing – for example on race starts. Launch Control limits engine torque so as to provide the maximum torque transferable to the rear wheel.</p>
      <p>This means the rider has to focus less on the throttle because he is controlling acceleration solely using the clutch. In addition, when Launch Control is activated, engine torque is reduced as soon as the system detects front wheel lift. This prevents unwanted wheelies when accelerating.</p>
      <p>The HP4 allows the rider to make instant gearshifts with virtually no interruption of traction force by means of the shift assistant, equipped as standard. This helps gain valuable fractions of a second on the race track, too.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Weight_reduction">
      <header>Weight reduction</header>
      <p>New 7-spoke wheels in forged light alloy and a new, lighter sprocket carrier give the HP4 a weight reduction of 5.3 lbs (2.4 kg) as compared to the S 1000 RR. The exhaust system is made entirely of titanium and saves as much as 9.9 lbs (4.5 kg) as compared to the S 1000 RR, thereby enhancing the HP4’s handling qualities.</p>
      <p>The new exhaust system has a resonance pipe between cylinders two and three, a controlled acoustic valve and a closed-loop catalytic converter. It has been possible to improve the torque curve thanks to the new exhaust system, with the engine application adapted accordingly.</p>

      <header>Race ABS with IDM setting</header>
      <p>BMW Motorrad now takes another step forward in the HP4. The system has been further refined and in particular adapted for use on the race track. As before, it has four different modes for wet surface (“Rain”), road (“Sport”), race track with supersports tires (“Race”) and race track with slicks (“Slick”).</p>
      <p>In the modes “Rain”, “Sport” and “Race”, the Race ABS operates on a partially integral basis, in other words, the rear wheel is automatically braked when the front wheel brake is activated. This ensures that the motorcycle remains considerably more stable while braking achieving very short braking distances.</p>
      <p>In “Slick” mode, the Race ABS setting in the HP4 is now at maximum deceleration, giving the rider transparent feedback on traction at all times. The new IDM setting – developed during the German Superbike Championship – allows maximum deceleration at the grip limit of the tires.</p>
      <p>In this mode, both the rear wheel lift detection and ABS function are deactivated for the rear wheel, allowing skilled riders to control the HP4 using the rear wheel brake and perform brake drifts.</p>
